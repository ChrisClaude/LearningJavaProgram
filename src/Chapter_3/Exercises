3.12 (Invoice Class) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent
an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information as
instance variables—a part number (type String), a part description (type String), a quantity of the
item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double). Your class should have a constructor
that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e.,
multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the
quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to
0.0. Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.

3.15 (Removing Duplicated Code in Method main) In the AccountTest class of Fig. 3.9, method
main contains six statements (lines 13–14, 15–16, 28–29, 30–31, 40–41 and 42–43) that each display
an Account object’s name and balance. Study these statements and you’ll notice that they differ

only in the Account object being manipulated—account1 or account2. In this exercise, you’ll define
a new displayAccount method that contains one copy of that output statement. The method’s parameter
will be an Account object and the method will output the object’s name and balance. You’ll
then replace the six duplicated statements in main with calls to displayAccount, passing as an argument
the specific Account object to output.
Modify class AccountTest class of Fig. 3.9 to declare the following displayAccount method
after the closing right brace of main and before the closing right brace of class AccountTest:
public static void displayAccount(Account accountToDisplay)
{
// place the statement that displays
// accountToDisplay's name and balance here
}
Replace the comment in the method’s body with a statement that displays accountToDisplay’s
name and balance.
Recall that main is a static method, so it can be called without first creating an object of the
class in which main is declared. We also declared method displayAccount as a static method.
When main needs to call another method in the same class without first creating an object of that
class, the other method also must be declared static.
Once you’ve completed displayAccount’s declaration, modify main to replace the statements
that display each Account’s name and balance with calls to displayAccount—each receiving as its
argument the account1 or account2 object, as appropriate. Then, test the updated AccountTest
class to ensure that it produces the same output as shown in Fig. 3.9.

Making a Difference

3.16 (Target-Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that
your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American
Heart Association (AHA) (www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4736), the
formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years.
Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are
estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness
and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health-care professional before
beginning or modifying an exercise program.] Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes
should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for
the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters.
For each attribute provide set and get methods. The class also should include a method that
calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a method that calculates and returns the person’s
maximum heart rate and a method that calculates and returns the person’s target heart rate. Write a
Java app that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object of class HeartRates and
prints the information from that object—including the person’s first name, last name and date of
birth—then calculates and prints the person’s age in (years), maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate
range.

3.17 (Computerization of Health Records) A health-care issue that has been in the news lately is
the computerization of health records. This possibility is being approached cautiously because of
sensitive privacy and security concerns, among others. [We address such concerns in later exercises.]
Computerizing health records could make it easier for patients to share their health profiles and histories
among their various health-care professionals. This could improve the quality of health care,
help avoid drug conflicts and erroneous drug prescriptions, reduce costs and, in emergencies, could
save lives. In this exercise, you’ll design a “starter” HealthProfile class for a person. The class attributes
should include the person’s first name, last name, gender, date of birth (consisting of separate
100 Chapter 3 Introduction to Classes, Objects, Methods and Strings
attributes for the month, day and year of birth), height (in inches) and weight (in pounds). Your class
should have a constructor that receives this data. For each attribute, provide set and get methods.
The class also should include methods that calculate and return the user’s age in years, maximum
heart rate and target-heart-rate range (see Exercise 3.16), and body mass index (BMI; see
Exercise 2.33). Write a Java app that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object of
class HealthProfile for that person and prints the information from that object—including the person’s
first name, last name, gender, date of birth, height and weight—then calculates and prints the
person’s age in years, BMI, maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range. It should also display
the BMI values chart from Exercise 2.33.
